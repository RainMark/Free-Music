#+title: Free-Music
Free Music (FM) is a open source music player. It's a local mp3 player before version 3.In version 3, we cut the local play function.Finally, it became to a online music player.
The development of FM is very slow, we hope more and more programmers can get involved in this project.
Below is a introduction of this project, I hope that it is usefull.
